#### _An exercise to practice building an API, 8.19.20_

#### By _**Kevin Davis and Taylor Phillips**_

<br>

## Description

_This was a practice in building our own API.  We constructed a Travel_API with locations and information about the specific places.  Throughout the project build we were able to implement pagination, tokenization, and some swagger documentation.  There is no client side application to this project yet._

## Specifications/Example Queries

| Spec |
| :--- |

Example Query:
`https://localhost:5000/api/locations/search?continent=australia`

`https://localhost:5000/api/locations/pages?pageNumber=1&pageSize=3`


<br>

## Software/Installation Requirements
* Install [Git v2.62.2+](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Install [.NET version 3.1 SDK v2.2+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Install [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)


## Setup 💻

Copy this url to clone this project to your local system using computer's Command Line terminal: 
```https://github.com/tayphill13/TravelApi.Solution.git```

If you wish to edit the code base: Open the project in your code editor; with Bash, this is done by navigating to the project directory `cd TravelApi.Solution`, then `code .`


## Database Setup/Migration

* Run MySQL by entering ```mysql -uroot -pepicodus``` in the terminal (In this example, 'epicodus' is the password, so if the word `password` was your password then you'd have ```msql -uroot -ppassword```)

* If you are using mysql workbench then the database can be generated by importing `travel_api.sql` located in the `TravelApi.Solution` directory.
* This can be found in the MySql Workbench `Server` menu as `Data Import`, then choose `Import from Self-Contained File`.  Use the browsing tool to select the `travel_api.sql` file that is included with the project and finally select `Start Import`.

* Within the project file, `appsettings.json` you will need to be sure that the password (pwd) matches the password that you are using for your MySql Workbench.
* Your appsettings.json file should follow this format: <br>

  ```{
  }
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port3306;database=databaseNameHere;uid=YourUserNameHere;pwd=YourPasswordHere;"
      }
  }
  ```

#### Alternatively,
* In your command line terminal, type `cd Desktop` then navigate to project folder using `cd TravelApi.Solution`
* Then navigate to `cd TravelApi` and type ``` dotnet ef migrations Initial ```
* Then type ``` dotnet ef database update ```
* You can confirm your the database has been created by going to the `Schemas` tab in your MySql Workbench and then right click and select `Refresh All` in the schema window.

### Running the program:
1. In your command line terminal, type `cd Desktop` then navigate to project folder using `cd TravelApi.Solution`
2. To run the program, you'll need navigate to the project folder by entering `cd TravelApi`, then to compile the code enter: `dotnet restore`. This will create a compiled application in the bin/ folder.  Do not touch the files in the bin/ or obj/ folders, you will not need to and the application will not run as intended.
3. You can then run the program directly with `dotnet run` while still within the TravelApi directory.

### OpenAPI Documentation:
